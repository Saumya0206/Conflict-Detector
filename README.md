# Branch Conflict Checker f

This repository extends the any project by introducing a **Branch Conflict Checker**. The Branch Conflict Checker is a GitHub Action that automatically checks for potential conflicts between branches when a pull request is created or updated. This helps identify potential file conflicts with open or recently merged pull requests that may modify the same files.

## Problem Statement

In a collaborative development environment, multiple developers may work on different branches simultaneously. When multiple pull requests modify the same files, there is a risk of conflicts during merging. The goal of this project is to automate the detection of these conflicts and provide immediate feedback when creating or updating a pull request.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:
